# Application Description

Use this section to describe your application.

The template app doesn't send any useful data, but provides a starting point to develop your own apps. 
This app is written in C++ and uses the Qt framework.

The important source files are listed below:

- `main.cpp` is the entry point
- `mainwindow.cpp` contains the UI code and code to access the recording device
- `mainwindow.hpp` is the corresponding header

## Dependencies

Use this section to describe what libraries/tools are required to RUN this application.
Build dependencies should be listed in the build instructions elsewhere.

For example, if the data provider uses a server/client architecture,
then the user will need to download, install, and run the server.

If the application requires a device library (typically a DLL on Windows, sometimes shipped in an SDK),
then instruct the user on how to obtain the library and how to install it on their system.
For example, "You must obtain the device_client.dll from the manufacturer. Copy that dll file into the
same folder as this application executable."

This template application has no dependencies.

## Download

Use this section to describe how/where to download prebuilt applications.
Typically this means using the GitHub repository release page.

# Build

This application can be built following general
[LSL Application build instructions](https://labstreaminglayer.readthedocs.io/dev/app_build.html).

Use this section to provide additional specific build instructions.
Alternatively, provide required information in a separate BUILD.md.
